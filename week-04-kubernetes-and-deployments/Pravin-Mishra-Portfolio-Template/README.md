## Footer – Version & Deploy Date

The website footer displays:
"Pravin Mishra Portfolio v1.0 — Deployed on <DD Mon YYYY> — By Venkatesh Gangavarapu"

The deploy date is generated dynamically using below JavaScript at runtime,
ensuring the date reflects the most recent deployment.
```bash
<script>
  const date = new Date();
  const options = { day: '2-digit', month: 'short', year: 'numeric' };
  document.getElementById('deployDate').textContent =
    date.toLocaleDateString('en-GB', options);
</script>
```


## Mandatory Ownership Proof (DMI Rule)
Before you deploy, you MUST edit the footer and add your details:

Original:

```html
<p>Crafted with <span>cloud</span> excellence by Pravin Mishra</p>
```

Add this line (example):

```html
<p><strong>Deployed by:</strong> DMI Cohort 2 | Rahul Sharma | Group 4 | Week 1 | 16-01-2026</p>
```

✅ This proof must be visible in your browser screenshot submission.
