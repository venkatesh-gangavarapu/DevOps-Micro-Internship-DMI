# Reflection – Confidence Project

This project taught me that real DevOps work starts **after deployment**.
OPS checks, ownership proof, and stability validation build real confidence.

Breaking the habit of “deploy and forget” was the biggest mindset shift.
Going forward, I will always validate systems like an on-call engineer.
