# OPS Reflection – Phase 1

## What I Learned
Networking checks must be validated from outside-in.
If traffic does not reach the server, application-level checks are useless.

## OPS Mindset Shift
Instead of assuming services are working, I now verify:
- Reachability
- Exposure
- Security first

## Key Takeaway
Production reliability starts with network truth, not application assumptions.
