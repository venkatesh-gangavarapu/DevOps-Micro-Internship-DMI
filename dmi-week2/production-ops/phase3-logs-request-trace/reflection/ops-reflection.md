# OPS Reflection – Phase 3

## What I Learned
Logs are the first place to look in production.
They reveal both visible and silent issues.

## OPS Mindset Shift
I now verify traffic and logs together,
not one without the other.

## Key Takeaway
If you cannot trace a request in logs,
you do not truly know what your system is doing.
