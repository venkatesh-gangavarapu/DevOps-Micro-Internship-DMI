# OPS Reflection – Phase 2

## What I Learned
A service being "up" is not enough.
It must also be restart-safe, observable, and predictable.

## OPS Mindset Shift
I now validate service behavior before deploys,
not after failures.

## Key Takeaway
If you cannot restart a service confidently,
you do not control production.
