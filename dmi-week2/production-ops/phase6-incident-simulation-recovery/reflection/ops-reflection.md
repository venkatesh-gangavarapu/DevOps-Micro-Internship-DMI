# OPS Reflection – Phase 6

## What I Learned
Recovery skills matter more than preventing every failure.
Failures are inevitable; response quality defines reliability.

## OPS Mindset Shift
I now think in terms of:
- blast radius
- safe rollback
- verification before and after

## Key Takeaway
If you can break and recover calmly,
you are ready for production on-call.
