# OPS Reflection – Phase 4

## What I Learned
CPU and memory spikes are visible quickly,
but disk exhaustion happens silently and causes severe outages.

## OPS Mindset Shift
I now treat disk usage as a first-class production risk,
not an afterthought.

## Key Takeaway
A healthy system today can fail tomorrow if capacity is ignored.
