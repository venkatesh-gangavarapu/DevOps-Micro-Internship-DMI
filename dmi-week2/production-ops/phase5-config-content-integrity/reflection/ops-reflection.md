# OPS Reflection – Phase 5

## What I Learned
Deployment success is not binary.
A service can be up but still serve the wrong content.

## OPS Mindset Shift
I now validate configuration and content together,
not just service availability.

## Key Takeaway
A release is only successful when the correct version
is proven to be live.
