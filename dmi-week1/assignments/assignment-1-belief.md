# Assignment 1 – A Belief Most People Disagree With

I strongly believe that with the right guidance, structured learning, and even paid courses, I can become a successful DevOps Engineer. Many people around me disagree with this belief because they think discipline and consistency alone matter more than external resources.

I admit that I struggled with consistency in the past, which made them doubt my approach. Some even laughed when I shared that I was selected for the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) Cohort 2. However, I still stand by my belief.

I believe discipline can be built over time, and structured programs provide clarity, direction, and accountability. With improved focus and commitment, I believe these courses can give me the foundation I need to achieve my long-term DevOps goals.
