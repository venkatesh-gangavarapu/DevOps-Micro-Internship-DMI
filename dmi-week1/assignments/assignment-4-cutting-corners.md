# Assignment 4 – Cutting Corners

**Answer:** Yes

**Emotion I felt:** Regret

I felt deep regret after choosing a role that prioritized comfort and work-life balance over technical challenge early in my career. While it reduced short-term stress, it slowed my learning and growth.

The regret was persistent and showed up as self-doubt and frustration. Realizing that I had traded long-term skill development for short-term ease was uncomfortable, but it also became a turning point. That awareness pushed me to choose discipline and growth over comfort moving forward.
